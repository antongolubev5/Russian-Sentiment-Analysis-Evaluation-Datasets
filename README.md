# Russian sentiment analysis evaluation datasets

Russian sentiment analysis evaluation datasets from past competitions are posted in this repository.


## ROMIP-2012

Opinions in direct or indirect speeches extracted from news articles.


## SentiRuEval-2015

Twitter datasets annotated for the task of reputation monitoring. The goal of the competition was to find sentiment-oriented opinions or positive and negative facts about two types of organizations: banks and telecom companies.

## SentiRuEval-2016

Similar to SentiRuEval-2015, but the training datasets in both domains were constructed by uniting of the training and test data of the SentiRuEval-2015 and, therefore they were much larger in size.
